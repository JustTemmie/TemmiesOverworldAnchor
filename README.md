# Temmie's Overworld Anchor

a very light fork of [Sit's End Anchor](https://github.com/timas130/SitsEndAnchor), for Minecraft 1.20.1, and ONLY 1.20.1

This mod adds a new block: the Sculk Anchor, which allows you to teleport in the Overworld dimension in a vanilla-like style.

## Crafting

Two obsidian and two sculk in the corners, four popped chorus fruit on the sides, and a lodestone compass pointing to a lodestone in the overworld.

> Unfortunately, this item does not appear in the recipe book, JEI, or other similar mods

## Using the block

Before you teleport, charging the anchor is required. Right-click with an echo nugget to do that, these can be obtained from turning echo shards into nuggets.

When charged, the block lights up, indicating that it's ready to be used. Right-click again to teleport.

You will be teleported on top of the lodestone the compass was pointing to.
If the lodestone is broken or obstructed, teleportation will fail.

## Breaking the block

If broken without Silk Touch, only the lodestone compass is dropped.
If the tool has Silk Touch, the whole block can be picked up.

## Explosions

If you try to use the Sculk anchor in another dimension (in the nether or the end), it will explode.
The explosion is two times bigger if the block had been charged before exploding.
